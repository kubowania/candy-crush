# candy-crush
A vanilla JavaScript Game inspired by Candy Crush - Built for learning purposes

In this walkthrough, I show you how to build Candy Crush in pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Watch the full video walkthrough [here](https://youtu.be/XD5sZWxwJUk): 

This walkthrough is great as it will show you how to drag and drop elements in JavaScript. This is a very popular element in building many JavaScript projects.

In addition to this, we will also be practising using inbuilt methods such as:

- addEventListener()
- setAttribute()
- setInterval()
- some()
- every()
- forEach()
- includes()
- contains()
- add()
- remove()
- createElement()
- appendChild()
- push()
- continue

And many more.

I would love to see your finished game to please do tag me on YouTube, Twitter (ania_kubow) or Instagram :)
